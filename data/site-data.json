      "The Phrygian Way (Frig Yolu) is one of Turkey's longest and most culturally rich hiking trails, stretching 506 kilometers through the ancient lands of Phrygia. Established in 2013 by a dedicated team of volunteers led by Hüseyin Sarı, this remarkable trail connects the modern provinces of Ankara, Afyonkarahisar, Eskişehir, and Kütahya.",
      "Journey through a landscape that has witnessed over 3,000 years of human civilization, from the mighty Phrygian Kingdom of King Midas to the Byzantine Empire and beyond. The trail passes through 44 traditional villages and 5 towns, offering an authentic glimpse into rural Turkish life unchanged for centuries.",
      "In 2018, the Phrygian Way was recognized as one of Europe's finest cultural routes, receiving acclaim for its outstanding historical preservation, sustainable tourism development, community engagement, and international trail standards. This recognition places the Phrygian Way alongside Europe's most prestigious hiking trails, including the Camino de Santiago and the Via Francigena."
